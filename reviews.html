	                    Rose showed up 15mins early for set up which was great as that didn‚Äôt eat up any face painting time
	                    and she brought an extra special chair and her art station is also a table so you don‚Äôt need to
	                    provide anything.
	                    She was quick with each child but her artwork was amazing and everyone was super pleased, most went
	                    back for an arm painting as she had plenty of time.
	                    Thank you Rose üåπ</p>
